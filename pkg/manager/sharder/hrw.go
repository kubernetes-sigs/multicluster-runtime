// HRW implements Highest-Random-Weight (aka Rendezvous) hashing.
//
// Given a stable cluster identifier and a snapshot of peers, HRW selects
// the peer with the highest score for that cluster. All peers compute the
// same scores independently, so the winner is deterministic as long as
// the inputs (clusterID, peer IDs, weights) are identical.
//
// Weighting: this implementation biases selection by multiplying the
// score with the peer's Weight (0 is treated as 1). This is a simple and
// fast heuristic; if you need proportional weighting with stronger
// distribution guarantees, consider the canonical weighted rendezvous
// formula (e.g., score = -ln(u)/w).
type HRW struct{}

// NewHRW returns a new HRW sharder.
func NewHRW() *HRW { return &HRW{} }

// ShouldOwn returns true if self is the HRW winner for clusterID among peers.
//
// Inputs:
//   - clusterID: a stable string that identifies the shard/cluster (e.g., namespace name).
//   - peers:     the full membership snapshot used for the decision; all participants
//     should use the same list (order does not matter).
//   - self:      the caller's peer info.
//
// Behavior & caveats:
//   - If peers is empty, this returns true (caller may choose to gate with fencing).
//   - Weight 0 is treated as 1 (no special meaning).
//   - Ties are broken by "last wins" in the iteration order (practically
//     unreachable with 64-bit hashing, but documented for completeness).
//   - The hash (FNV-1a, 64-bit) is fast and stable but not cryptographically secure.
//   - This method does not enforce ownership; callers should still use a
//     per-shard fence (e.g., a Lease) to serialize actual work.
//
// Determinism requirements:
//   - All peers must see the same peer IDs and weights when computing.
//   - clusterID must be stable across processes (same input â†’ same winner).
